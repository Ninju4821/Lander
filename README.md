# Lander
A web game based on ehmorris's lander game.
Built similar to the game pre the update that added landing zones.

## Future Plans
Up next is releasing a large scale graphics overhaul.
This game is mostly a hobbyist project released in my school, so most updates are suggestions from there, however if you post in issues with the enhancement label, I may take your idea into consideration.
(current version = v0.6.1)

## Where to play?
My website (*free hosting, working on it!*) is at http://ninjus-hub.great-site.net (Check out some other projects while your there!).
I also post games on my itch.io page: https://ninju4821.itch.io (though most projects there are either scrapped or on hold)
