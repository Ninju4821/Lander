# Lander
A web game based on ehmorris's lander game.
Built similar to the game before the update that added landing zones. This also includes some improvements and other suggestions.

## Future Plans
This game is mostly a hobbyist project released in my school, so most updates are suggestions from there, however if you post in issues with the enhancement label, I may take your idea into consideration.
(current version = v1.0.0)

## Where to play?
Currently, this game can be played at https://ninjus-hub.startuperror.xyz/web_root though a more permanent solution is being worked on currently.
I also post games on my itch.io page: https://ninju4821.itch.io (though most projects there are either scrapped or on hold)
