# Lander
A web game based on ehmorris's lander game.
Built similar to the game pre the update that added landing zones.

# Future Plans
I plan on first improving lander hitboxes, then releasing a large scale graphics overhaul.
This game is mostly a hobbyist project released in my school, so most updates are suggestions from there, however if you post in issues with the suggestion tag, I may take your idea into consideration.
(current version = v0.61)

# Where to play?
My website (free hosting, working on it!) is at http://ninjus-hub.great-site.net (Check out some other projects while your there!).
I also post games on my itch.io page: https://ninju4821.itch.io (though most projects there are either scrapped or on hold)
