# Lander
A web game based on ehmorris's lander game.
Built similar to the game before the update that added landing zones. This also includes some improvements and other suggestions.

## Collaboration
If you encounter any bugs, please create an Issue and I'll try to fix it ASAP. Also, as I have finished most of the changes I want to make for the game, so I am now open to collaboration on the project! To do so:
- Fork the repository ([github.com/Ninju4821/Lander](https://www.github.com/Ninju4821/Lander))
- Make your own changes to the code
- Submit a pull request
-- You must include changelogs or your request will be automatically denied.

## Future Plans
This game is mostly a hobbyist project released in my school, so most updates are suggestions from there, however if you post in issues with the enhancement label, I may take your idea into consideration.
(latest version = v1.1.3)

## Where to play?
Currently, this game can be played at [ninjus-hub.startuperror.xyz/root](https://ninjus-hub.startuperror.xyz/root) via GitHub Pages, though a more permanent solution is currently being worked on.
I also post games on my itch.io page: [ninju4821.itch.io](https://ninju4821.itch.io) (though most projects there are either scrapped or on hold)
